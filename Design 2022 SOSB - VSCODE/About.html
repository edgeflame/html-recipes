      This product has been made because recently the school
      cafeterias have been focusing on<br> only Indian and very seldomly on Italian food. 
      I wish to eliminate this by providing a more <br>balanced diet with different cultural
      varieties.     
      </p>
      </div>
        <p class="about-content-2">
        To do this, I've researched about various recipes and their nutritional information, taste, cost<br> 
        and
         how effecient they would be in replacing the current
          school cafeteria system. However,<br> Indian food will
          will still be served due to the familiary we possess
           regarding our culture, and<br> the convenience of making
            it with already present ingredients.

  The recipes I have shortlisted are from Greek,
  Japenese and Vietnamese. This is because<br> the source (healthline)
   considers them one of the top healthy cuisines 
   among their 10 <br>shortlisted cuisines. To know why, 
   keep reading below.

  <h2 class="greek">GREEK CUISINE</h2>
  <p>One of the most<br> researched diets is the
    traditional Greek diet. It places a strong emphasis on grains, beans,<br>
     vegetables, fish, and unsaturated fats. As a result of its well-known 
     ingredients, chickpeas,<br> peppers, and sardines, this food has
      exceptionally high nutritional qualities, especially in
      <br> omega-3. The surprising lack of meat in it further
        lowers the intake of saturated fats. Given <br>that "salad"
         and "yoghurt" are typically used after the word "Greek," 
         it shouldn't come as a <br>huge surprise that this national 
         cuisine is one of the healthiest in the entire globe.</p>

  <h2>JAPANESE CUISINE</h2>
  <p class="japanese-cuisine">Balance, diversity, and moderation are the three cornerstones
    of healthy eating, and<br> the Japanese diet serves as an excellent
     example of each. People frequently live to be<br> over 100 years
      old in some regions of Japan, such as Okinawa, and their nutrition
       has<br> a significant impact on this. Foods like yams, green tea, seaweed,
        soy products, and<br> shiitake mushrooms also have a number of
         health benefits, including being high in <br>iron, calcium, 
         zinc, copper, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants. The
         diet is abundant<br> in fruits and vegetables, which have been
          shown to have cancer-fighting properties. <br>  Many of their 
          foods are steamed or quickly fried, and many of them
           practise the art of<br> Hara Hachi Bu, or eating until you're
            80% full, at the dining table. These eating habits<br> only
      
            increase the health benefits of their diet.</p>

  <h2 class="thai-heading">THAILAND CUISINE</h2>
  <img src="images/thai.webp" class="thai-img">
  <div class="description-thai"><h2 class="THAILAND"></h2>
    <p>Thai cuisine is one of the world's healthiest because it is bursting with potent flavours and frequently contains a lot of veggies.
  
      Turmeric, coriander, ginger, lemongrass, and chilli peppers are a few of the spices and flavours that distinguish Thai cuisine.
      Curcumin, a substance found in turmeric in particular, has been intensively researched for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities (14Trusted Source).
      
      Additionally, garlic and onions, which both have anti-cancer qualities and have been shown in test-tube tests to help inhibit the growth of cancer cells, are frequently used in Thai cuisine</p></div>
